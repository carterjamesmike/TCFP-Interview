# TCFP Programming Test (React)

## About

This project will help us evaluate your [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and Javascript knowledge. This is a
[NextJS]() project but we are not going to be using any of its features.

One of the most important things we do at the Texas Commission of Fire Protection is to track how firefighters
get injured at the line of duty. In order to make their jobs safer, we look at this data to see how we
can prevent them from happening.

## Injury Reports

Consider that you are in a team of software developers and a colleague developed most of the application
and you have to add a few features. This application is basically a system that will manage Injury Reports.
Users will be able to create, read, update and delete them. Your job is to ensure that the application
does that in the most user friendly way, with the help of [Tailwind CSS]().

We have a state with an array of Injury Report objects. Your job will be to fill in the blanks wherever
you see comments that say `TODO`. Once you get everything working, we would like you to split some UI elements
components. For example, the modal, the form and the buttons could be easily their component.

Good luck!

## Get Started

This project was created with Visual Studio Code in mind. You will need Node version 16 or greater. Once you do,
install the dependencies:

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

Hot Reload is built in to improve your DX.

## Evaluation

The first criteria for evaluation will be if the application does what its supposed to do without any bugs: create, read, update, delete
injury reports.

The second criteria will be both code quality and UI/UX.
